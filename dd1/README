hello,

i've just tryed to port this to autoconf ( what is automake ? ).
please run ./configure if config.h ( is autoconf avaliable ( <= ?! ) on
emmess WIN16 + 15.5 ? ) is missing. ( should I include a ready-to-use config.h
for poor mSS users ? ). 

if you cannot find 'configure' in this dir, try 
<UNIX>
something like 'autoheader && autoconf && chmod 755 configure && ./configure'
<XINU>

<WIN>
try to find autoconf for your toy and try to do something similiar
to <UNIX>
<NIW>
